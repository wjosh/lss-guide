Hero skills are divided into **\[Combat Skills], \[Status Skills], \[Prep Skills], \[Passive Skills]** and **\[Dictator Skills]**. 

### \[Combat Skills] 🌱🌱

Combat skill is the most important source of damage output during battle. It can only be activated when it is the Hero squad's turn. Once the Hero is Silenced, Suppressed, or their troops drop to zero, the skill cannot be activated. 

### \[Status Skills] 🍁🍁

In general, Status skills provides the Hero with a buff without needing to be "activated." Even when Silenced or Suppressed, the skill can take effect normally. Once the Hero's troops drop to zero, the buff will disappear. 

### \[Passive Skills] 💦💦

Passive skills usually require a specific trigger before it is activated, such as a normal attack. 
Like Status skills, Passive can take effect even when the Hero is silenced or suppressed. However, Passive skills often require normal attacks as a trigger, so if the Hero squad's normal attack is disabled, the passive will become useless. 

### \[Prep Skill] 🔥🔥

Prep skills are the most stable and reliable skills. They are already in effect before the start of the battle and will not be affected by abnormal conditions such as Silence and Suppression or when the Hero squad's troops drop to zero. 

### \[Dictator Skills] ✨✨


Dictator skill is different from the above four skills. Instead, it tends to increase the troop number or basic attributes such as Might and Resistance. Each Hero's Dictator skills are slightly changed but roughly the same overall. 

When using skills, you also need to pay attention to their effective range.
